## ABOUT US
In 2006, SURROUND's three founders (Brad McCusker, Michael D'Aprix, and Marcus Jowsey) set out to transform the way government works. The team has worked together over many years to develop solutions to the hurdles governments face when accessing, analysing, and managing their knowledge base.

SURROUND's core mission is to provide value to citizens by providing government agencies with business intelligence and information integration tools at a fraction of their current costs.

The team at SURROUND uses modern tools and sophisticated approaches to data management to help solve complex knowledge problems so that federal, state, and local governments of all sizes can collaborate more effectively, make smarter evidence-based decisions, and achieve greater citizen well-being.
