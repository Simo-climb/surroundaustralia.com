<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>In 2015, SURROUND's two founders (Brad McCusker and Marcus Jowsey) set out to transform the way government and business work.</p>
<p>Our focus is linking knowledge in order to assist organisations to make improved empirical, traceable, and explainable decisions. The SURROUND team has created an integrated knowledge engineering platform using semantic, knowledge graph, and machine learning (ML) technologies.</p>
<p>SURROUND's core mission is to provide value to our customers and the broader citizen community by providing government agencies and business with cost-effective solutions which address and solve organisational complexity. Our solutions leverage global standards and world-class algorithms in the design of generic or customised solutions as required.</p>

            <h4>Dr Nicholas Car</h4>
            <p class="jobtitle">Data Systems Architect</p>
            <p>Nicholas’ main experience is in building distributed data systems for government. For 15 years (on and off) he worked at CSIRO, first as a Ph.D. student addressing informatics challenges in agriculture, then as a research engineer on water data systems, and finally as an experimental computer scientist. Most recently, he was the design lead for several innovative Linked Data and Semantic Web projects including the <a href="http://locationindex.org">Location Index</a> spine and <a href="https://longspine.cat/">Longitudinal Spine of Government Functions</a>. They aim to provide collections of integrated, reference Australian government datasets allowing for data integration.</p>
            <p>He has also worked as the Data Architect of Geoscience Australia, advising on agency-wide data systems and managing technical and data policy teams.</p>
            <p>Currently, Nicholas is active as a web standards editor in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page">W3C’s Dataset Exchange Working Group</a>, a co-chair of the <a href="http://www.linked.data.gov.au">Australian Government Linked Data Working Group</a>, and a member of the <a href="https://www.isotc211.org">ISO's TC 211</a>, Technical Committee for the geographic standards information.</p>

            <h4>Dr Anne Cregan</h4>
            <p class="jobtitle">Semantic Technologist &amp; Technical Pre-Sales Consultant</p>
            <p>Anne has had a long career in IT spanning software development, business analysis and management as well as specialist knowledge in Semantic Technologies and Knowledge Representation.  In 2014, Anne was the Semantic Lead on the <a href="https://huni.net.au/#/about">HuNI project</a>, responsible for integrating 17.7 million records from 32 disparate data sources from leading Australian cultural institutions. These were made available to the public through a dynamic knowledge graph (using similar semantic methodologies) and function-rich GUI.  Semantic modelling and transformation was vital to the successful integration and inter-linking of the 32 sources into a single queryable knowledge graph.  Anne has participated in W3C Working Groups including OWL2 Development and has recently been invited to participate on the Standards Australia Committee for Artificial Intelligence, IT-043 which mirrors the ISO.</p>
