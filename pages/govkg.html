<h1>Gov Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>GovKG is a data product built and managed by SURROUND. It contains a series of datasets of information about government; its structure, the functions it performs and capacity.</p>
<h4 style="font-style:italic;">Which government?</h4>
<p>GovKG started with Australian federal government data but, since it's an estansible kowledge graph, its being extended to include Australian state information, local council info and New Zealand government info. It also includes several international datastats of government function needed to match Australian (or NZ) functions with those listed by the OECD &amp; UN.</p>

            <h4>What we've done</h4>
            <p>We've ingested a number of well-used datasets (see below) and 'up-skilled' them by defining formal data models for them which include data definitions and links to other defined data.</p>
