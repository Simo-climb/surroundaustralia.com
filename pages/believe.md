# What We Believe

#### SURROUND has strong values that guide what we do and who we work with

Some of these beliefs are about what we should be doing, others about how to do it.

### What to do
We do what we believe in and that is:

1. **Working for the public good**
  * improving the welfare of Australians is a primary goal of SURROUND's
  * providing for the greater utilisation of public knowledge assets 
  * increasing the transparency and accountability for all Governments
  * "do no evil"'s not good enough, how about "do good"?

2. **Assisting government to govern**
  * small tech copmanies can assist government to govern by doing things government can't, such as addressing fast-moving technical challenges agilely
  * pooling skills quickly for xAI (see below), Machine Learning and Semantic Knowledge Graphs
  * whatever we do should be *with* government, not against it!

### How we do it
We achieve our goals by:

1. **Believing the key to institutional knowledge is interoperable *data***
  * as opposed to systems interoperability
  * data interoperability relies on good data semantics - is one "10m" value the same another "10m"?
2. **Using Knowledge Graphs**
  * KGs are relatively new data structures
  * KGs contain their schema within them and can be infinitely expanded as long as terms can be defined
    * this allows us to connect lots of disparate data together
    * whatever can be connected can be queried!
3. **Producing Explanable AI**
  * we use *semantic data* for everything, that is data with strong definitions for all parts
  * use of semantic data and good process *[provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance#Computer_science)* means we can explain everything we do
  * we use advanced analytics techniques, forms of AI, to learn new things from data and it's always explanable
