# What We Believe

#### SURROUND has strong values that guide what we do and who we work with

Some of these beliefs are about what we should be doing, others about how to do it.

### What to do
We believe in:

1. **Working for the public good**
  * "do no evil"'s not good enough, how about "do good"?
    * improving the welfare of Australians is a primary goal of SURROUND's
2. **Assisting government govern**
  * small tech copmanies can assist government to govern by doing things government can't, such as addressing fast moving technical challenges agilely
  * whatever we do should be *with* government, not against it!

### How we do it
We achieve our goals by:

1. **Believing the key to institutional knopwledge is interoperable *data***
  * as opposed to systems interoperability
  * data interoperability relies on good data semantics - is one "10m" value the same another "10m"?


##### If you share our beliefs, then likely we'll get on really well!
