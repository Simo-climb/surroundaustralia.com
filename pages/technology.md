# Technology
### SURROUND is a high-tech company that focusses on data rather than systems.

We support a number of products that all implement [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology to some extend and some of which also implement various forms of [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). This is because we believe that data structures backed by moden, formal, data models such as Semantic Web *ontologies* are just so much more powerful than other forms of data. With powerful data, we can then perform ML processes that 'learn' to produce better results, via some sort of feedback, than static systems can.

    <h4>
        Semantics + ML really do work well together to generate better results, over time, on top of best-case data.

Please see our [Products page](/products) for a list of our supported products, their underlying platforms. Each contains information about the technology they use.
